# of numerization artifacts, from the "perfect page" as a color pixel array #
# physical artifacts : paper-texture, 3D warping of the page (including 3D
# rotation), shadows (inner page) # image acquisition artifacts : OPTICS :
# gaussian noise (bluriness), chromatic aberation, SENSOR : photon noise,
# backgound noise, Dark shot noise (hot pixels), reading noise # data processing
# : binerization, compressing # data storage : output as another color or
# monochrome pixel array, to save a a specific given type
